# BAMAZON

## Customer Menu

Created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app track product sales across the store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Initializing node bamazonCustomer.js in the command line brings up the storefront. It will ask you what you'd like to purchase by item number and how many:

If there are enough quantities the app calculate your total amout and then offer to proceed or finish your purshase.
